    <h1>Domination</h1>

    <div class="details">
      <h2 style="text-align:center;"> Details </h2>
      <p style="margin-top:20px;"> Domination game mode has two teams with two small bases similar to those of 4team mode randomly placed in two of the four corners of the map. There are four large, formidable structures called dominators in four spots on the map close to the corners and bases. They are each defended by either a slow moving immensively destructive cannon, a quick moving machine gun similar to a gunner, or a trapper with many quick node-spouting guns. These dominators will be controlled by AI unless a player presses the "H" key while another player is not in the dominator. Then, the player will be in control of one of the dominators of their team. The object of the game is to capture all of the dominators, which at first are all neutral. By shooting the dominators until their health is gone, one team can gain control of it. When all dominators are in the possession of one team, that team wins. Methods to retain domination don't work in this game mode; once one team is sufficiently dominant it wins the game. All modes have the relatively weak triangles in the middle which attack players. While one won't cause too much damage, don't let their numbers build up. </p>
