    <h1 class="center"> Tactics </h1>
    <p> OVERSEER </p>
	<ul>
		<li> destroyers are very effective against overseer and their upgrades, often able to obliterate and shoot past all their minions with one shot. This is especially useful if the overseer has become defensive, keeping its minions concentrated in one spot </li>
	</ul>
    <p> TRAPPERS </p>
	<ul>
		<li> destroyers are also very effective against various forms of trappers, being able to shoot straight through any defensive clusters of their "bullets" they create. This can form a direct path for someone else, if it doesn't kill the trapper directly </li>
	</ul>
    <p> TEAMWORK </p>
	<ul>
		<li> destrotyers often can be very valuable to bullet storms, providing a deadly and often disorienting aspect </li>
		<li> destroyers also work well with other players harrassing the opponent, distracting them long enough for the destroyer to take the final shot </li>
	</ul>
    <p> HARRASSMENT </p>
	<ul>
		<li> destroyers are very good at harrassment, using their speed to surprise an enemy before firing a few fatal shots and using their speed to retreat </li>
	</ul>
