      <p style="margin-top:20px;"> FFA game mode stands for Free For All. There are no teams, no bases, and no consistent friends. Domination most methods sort of work, although they are difficult to maintain without a team to assist you or bases to target. The only consistent one is to hoard the middle area, with all the pentagons. Most players aim to reach the top of the leaderboard. All modes have the relatively weak triangles in the middle which attack players. While one won't cause too much damage, don't let their numbers build up. </p>
