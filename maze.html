      <p style="margin-top:20px;"> In the Maze game mode the map is a random maze. The walls slow you down, and destroy your bullets or minions/triangles (but they don't kill you). Methods of retaining dominance are dificult here, as the middle area with all the pentagons can be split by walls and the entire map is cut up into illusive territories and mazes. Constantly check your map to be sure you aren't cornering yourself, and prioritize health and health regen more than is recomended. Tanks with the abilities to hide and dominate small spaces can effectively dominate this game mode. It is similar to FFA in that there are no teams and no bases. All modes have the relatively weak triangles in the middle which attack players. This game mode is the slowest in which to upgrade. While one won't cause too much damage, don't let their numbers build up. </p>
