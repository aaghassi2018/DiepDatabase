      <p style="margin-top:20px;"> In tag mode, there are teams but no bases. When an opponent is killed, it joins the team that killed it. When one team holds all the players, that team has won. Methods of lasting domination are irrelevant in this mode, when one team becomes dominant and starts practicing them it winns. Fast tanks such as triangles are useful in this game mode, esspecially in the end when it becomes a man-hunt for the last remaining players on opposing teams. As players die often and the game is won and lost often, it is a slow mode to upgrade in. All modes have the relatively weak triangles in the middle which attack players. While one won't cause too much damage, don't let their numbers build up. </p>
