      <p style="margin-top:20px;"> 4teams game mode has four teams with four bases, one in each corner, the bases are smaller than those of two teams, but are guarded better by unbeatable triangles. This game mode often involves more encounters with opponents and a faster pace than two teams, making it fast to upgrade but easy to die and lose the progress. In 4team mode, it is easier to retain dominance once your team is dominant. Tactics such as hoarding the middle area, with all the pentagons, wiping out small resources near opponents bases, and harrassing opponents which appear to be gaining more upgrades are all effective in 4team mode. All modes have the relatively weak triangles in the middle which attack players. While one won't cause too much damage, don't let their numbers build up. </p>
