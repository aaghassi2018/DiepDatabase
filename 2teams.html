      <p style="margin-top:20px;"> In two teams game mode, there are two teams with bases on the left and right of the map. The bases last the entire length of each side of the map, but aren't as well guarded by the unbeatable triangles as the smaller bases of 4team mode, so that opponents can get closer. The opponents and battles generally of 2team mode are more dispersed and easier to avoid, so it is one of the faster game modes to upgrade in. You have a larger base to retreat to as well, but less protection in it than in most bases. It is difficult to retain dominance in 2team mode, as the area to cover is very dispersed. Opponents are likely to upgrade unhindered. The only tactic which may slow them down is hoarding the middle area, with all the pentagons. All modes have the relatively weak triangles in the middle which attack players. While one won't cause too much damage, don't let their numbers build up. </p>
